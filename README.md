# WebGL
A repo where I share my knowledge about WebGL and make WebGL programs using JavaScript.

## Running programs

If you want to run any of the programs, do the following:

### Clone the repo

Clone the repo using:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/refiloemopeloa/WebGL.git
```

### Install dependencies

Navigate to the `programs` directory. Then, from your terminal, run:

```shell
npm install
```

This will install all the modules needed for the programs to run.

### Run a program

Each program has its own run script in each directory. From each directory, you can type the following in the terminal:

```shell
npm run start
```

This will run the program and open an instance in your default browser.
